Raw data:
list of subjests in order they were observed, activity performed by each subject during the observations (1-6), data obtained by the accelerometer

Processed Data:
Subject where converted to Subject.ID (1-30), Activity number where converted to Activity (levels Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing, Laying).Unites of all the other variables (Body.Acc.Mean.X, Body.Acc.Mean.Y, Body.Acc.Mean.Z, Body.Acc.SD.X, Body.Acc.SD.Y, Body.Acc.SD.Z) remain unchanged.The data for mean of acceleration was divided into Body.Acc.Mean.X (for acceleration in X axis), Body.Acc.Mean.Y (for acceleration in Y axis), Body.Acc.Mean.Z (for acceleration in Z axis) respectively.The data for Standard Deviation of acceleration was divided to Body.Acc.SD.X (for acceleration in X axis), Body.Acc.SD.Y (for acceleration in Y axis), Body.Acc.SD.Z (for acceleration in Z axis) respectively.
